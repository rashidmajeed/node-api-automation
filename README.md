## Nodejs API project

#### Complete setup of project

```bash

This is a very simple API you can use for learning API Testing. It is built using express and nodejs. It stores data into a JSON File stored under "database" folder with the name "PFMembers.json". There are five endpoints in this api.

1. ### Members - http://localhost:5002/api/members
    * GET ALL (/) - This will return all the members. You can also use query parameter to filter out based on gender.
    * GET (/ID) - You can retrieve a specific member based on it's ID.
    * POST (/) - You can POST a new members into PFMembers.json file.
    * PUT (/ID) - You can UPDATE an existing member into PFMembers.json file by providing BOTH NAME and GENDER.
    * PATCH (/ID) - You can UPDATE an existing member into PFMembers.json file by providing either NAME or GENDER or BOTH.
